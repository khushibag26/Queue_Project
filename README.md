* Here are the requirements for each model:
1) One line for customers, with n checkout stations. Customers go to the next available station.
2) n lines for customers, with one checkout station per line. Customers go to the line with the fewest number of customers.
3) n lines for customers, with one checkout station per line. Customers go to a randomly chosen line.
